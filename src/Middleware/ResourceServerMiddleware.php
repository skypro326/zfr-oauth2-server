 * Middleware for a resource server
 *
 * This middleware aims to sit very early in your pipeline. It will check if a request has an access token, and if so,
 * will try to validate it. If the token is invalid, the middleware will immediately return.
 *
 * If the token is valid, it will store it as part of the request under the attribute "oauth_token", so that it can
 * be used later one by a permission system, for instance
